	  I have TA'd a variety of courses since Spring 2023 at the University of Illinois (UIUC) and the University of Maryland (UMD).
      <br>Most courses have had a focus on general biology and writing skills.
      <br>List of courses taught over the years:
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>HORT 105:</b> Vegetable Gardening Lab (UIUC)</li>
	    <li><b>PLPA 200:</b> Plants, Pathogens, & People (UIUC)</li>
	    <li><b>CPSC 116:</b> The Global Food Production Web (UIUC)</li>
	    <li><b>BSCI 171:</b> Principles of Molecular & Cellular Biology Lab (UMD)</li>

	  </ul>
	   I have been selected to the University of Illinois's <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/qdsospiywv7f0v1x4xks74qqzmid27ib/file/2049061580404">List of Teachers Ranked as Outstanding by Their Students</a> for HORT 105 and CPSC 116.
      <p>
        <br>
        I aim to create an energetic class environment, keeping students engaged and curious. I want my students to not be afraid of making mistakes and to own up to them so that they can continue improving on their journey to becoming young scientists.

<h3><u>Resources For Students</u></h3>
		
		<p>
			As part of the <b>Grad School Application Workshop</b> held in Spring 2024, I prepared a document that serves as a guide for what to consider when applying to grad schhols.
			<br>
			Access the document here: <a href="docs/grad_school.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>

<h3><u>Food Resources & Pantries</u></h3>
	  <p>
	    Aside from my teaching responsibilities I am also passionate about <b>addressing food insecurity</b> on campus and inform my students of various assistance programs such as:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://campusrec.illinois.edu/wellness/food-assistance">https://campusrec.illinois.edu/wellness/food-assistance</a></li>

        </ul>
	  </p>

<h3><u>Community Resources</u></h3>
<p>
There are a wide variety of cultural centers on campus that you can find here: <a href="https://newstudent.illinois.edu/connected/cultural-centers">https://newstudent.illinois.edu/connected/cultural-centers</a>.  Most of these have weekly events either 12-1 with a lunch provided and numerous other programs that I encourage you all to attend especially if you are a new or international student. Outside of these resources linked below I also want to encourage you to go to: <a href="https://one.illinois.edu/club_signup">https://one.illinois.edu/club_signup</a> and look for student clubs you find interesting and go to their events. There are many hobby based groups and some identity based groups so there are a lot of options.
</p>
 
<p>
Here is a list of some campus units (please let me know if I am missing one) that cater to specific groups of identities as it always helps to find community with people that have similar experiences and these also have opportunities for you to find mentors or programs to help you succeed in academics or otherwise.
