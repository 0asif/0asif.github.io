            <b>My MS journey: </b>I came to the US in Fall 2022 to pursue a MS in Bioinformatics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
            I had an amazing experience working alongside my mentor and supervisor <a href="http://gca.cropsci.illinois.edu/gca.html">Dr. Gustavo Caetano-Anollés</a>.
            I also want to acknowledge my MS thesis committee: <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/rodrgzzs-lab/">Dr. Sandra Rodriguez-Zas</a> and <a href="https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/directory/villamil">Dr. Maria Bonita Villamil</a>.
            They have been great mentors and had great questions during my MS thesis defense.
        </p>

            <b>My (somewhat tumultuous) PhD Journey: </b>After graduating in Spring 2024 I chose to continue my grad school journey at the <a href="https://www.bisi.umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a>.
            Unfortunately due to the federal and state budget cuts of 2025 my department lost funding to continue supporting me after my second semester.
            I am happy to restart my PhD back at the University of Illinois at the <a href="http://gca.cropsci.illinois.edu/gca.html">GCA Bioinformatics Lab</a>, where I will continue to explore evolutionary bioinformatics.
        </p>
		
        <p> <b>Past Research & Current Interests: </b>My research focused on exploring the structural repertoire of major SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins using AlphaFold to model 
            haplotypes that had significant prevalence rates in the population during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am interested in evolutionary
            bioinformatics and addressing questions related to how proteins evolve and why.
